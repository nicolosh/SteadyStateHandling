# VehiCool

`VehiCool` is a MATLAB library to animate vehicles in 3D.

It is currently under development. The current version is `0.2.0`, which is still in alpha stage.

**Beware that the API may change in the future.**

## Features

Hereafter a list of the implemented and upcoming features. The list is not exhaustive, but it gives a good idea of the library capabilities. For a more detailed description of the implemented features, please refer to the [`FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md) file.

### Implemented

- [x] Visualize single/multi-body objects in 3D (at the moment the library supports STL and scatter objects by default, but adding new ones is very easy).
- [x] Visualize 2D/3D tracks. (not fully tested)
- [x] Animate and/or save a video in post-processing/step-by-step (i.e., one step at a time, as if it was attached to a simulation).
- [x] Deferred update of objects (i.e., asynchronous update of objects).

### Upcoming

- [ ] Default object collections (i.e., ready-to-go multi-body systems).

## Dependencies

This library uses the following third-party libraries.

- [`madhouse-utils`](https://github.com/DRIVEWISE/madhouse-utils) (provided as a submodule of the library).
- [`ebertolazzi/Clothoids`](https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64849-ebertolazzi-clothoids) (to be downloaded freely as a MATLAB package).

Whilst `madhouse-utils` is used internally throughout the library, `ebertolazzi/Clothoids` is used only for the visualization of the racetrack which takes as input the left and right margins of the track. If you do not need that feature, you can safely remove the dependency.

## Quick setup

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can add the library to your MATLAB path by running the following command

```
addpath( genpath( 'path/to/VehiCool' ) );
```

then you can use the library by following this workflow example

```
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%% Load the data
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
...

%% Define the scenario
track = RaceTrack( left_margin, right_margin );
car   = STLObject( car_state, ...
                   'STLPath', 'models/cars/Renault_5_Rallye_Edition/Renault_5_Rallye_Edition.stl' );
cam   = FollowerCamera( car );

%% Create and populate the scenario
scene = VehiCool();
scene.set_track( track );
scene.add_camera( cam );
scene.add_root_object( car );

%% Animate the scenario
scene.animate( time_sim(end) );
```

For a more detailed example, please refer to the [`examples`](examples/README.md) folder.

## Documentation

At the moment the documentation is not available. In the meantime, you can refer to the [`examples`](examples/README.md) folder and to the [`source code`](src) which are well documented. In addition, you can refer to the [`FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md) file which describes the implemented features in detail.
