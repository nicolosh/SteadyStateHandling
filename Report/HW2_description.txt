The goal of this assignment is the analysis of the steady state behaviour of a F-SAE formula type car. Example data are provided via Matlab m-file. Using the vehicle dynamic model provided the data have two be adapted according to the provided file and the tyre data fitted in the previous assignment has to be used. 

The vehicle model has to be used to simulate steady state tests such as steer ramp test at constant speed and or speed ramp test at constant steering angle. You have to derive the corresponding normalised axle characteristics, the handling diagram and compar the theoretical with the fitted steering gradients. Additionally the effect of suspension roll stiffness, camber and toe angle effect on steering characteristics have to be analysed. Optionally also the chassis stiffness can be investigated

What you have to do

    Modify data according the provide M-file and use the tyre fitted data. Modify the vehicle model if necessary
    Set up steer ramp and speed ramp test and collect corresponding telemetry data.
    Compute main parameters and indices such as:
        lateral load transfer
        normalised axle characteristics 
        handling diagram
        understeering gradient (theoretical and fitted)
        yaw gain, beta gain 
    Evaluate the effect of suspension stiffness, static toe angle and camber angle on handling.

What has to be delivered at the deadline?

You have to :

    a short report   where each team summarises the result obtained reporting the plot and related comments.
    the Matlab and Simulaink files to perform the simulations.
