# Dynamics of Vehicles (HW-2) :: Steady State Handling
Second assignment for the Biral's Project for the MSc Degree @ UNITN  (Dynamics of Vehicles course):
the focus for this project will be about Steady State Handling but there will be also room for Transient Response.

> In particular, the goal of this assignment is the analysis of the steady state behaviour of a F-SAE formula type car. Example data are provided via a Matlab m-file. Using the vehicle dynamic model provided the data have two be adapted according to the provided file and the tyre data fitted in the previous assignment has to be used.

The vehicle model has to be used to simulate steady state tests such as steer ramp test at constant speed and or speed ramp test at constant steering angle. You have to derive the corresponding normalised axle characteristics, the handling diagram and compare the theoretical with the fitted steering gradients. Additionally the effect of suspension roll stiffness, camber and toe angle effects on steering characteristics have to be analysed.
